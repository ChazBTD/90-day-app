def try_generate_banner(super_goal: str) -> bytes:
    prompt = f"""
    Please help me design a 1536:512 landscape dashboard banner for this super goal: {super_goal}
    If the original super goal text is has more than 12 words or has complex wording:
    - adapt to to a banner title by removing excessive details
    - keep the keywords and a key number
    - focus on practical action verbs (eg. reach, learn, make) ignore common english sentence structure

    The optimized super goal title is placed in the top-left overlay in a clean, bold title font.
    The main element of the banner is the cartoon:
    - The theme of the goal should illustrated through a primary subject
    - The story telling is complete through lighthearted and humurous states and actions
    - ONLY if suitable, humour can be convyed with exaggerated body proportions, especially through contrast with multiple characters
    
    Specific artistic choice for the cartoon:
    - Simple and bold look for characters, settings, and props
    - Preferably consistent line style: Thick, black outlines with rounded ends; no sketchy or variable stroke.
    - No background wash. Simple Palette: Most lines are black on white; 1â€‘2 selective colours fills only as accent for goalâ€‘defining items (eg. youtube plaque, computer)
    - Tweak the style of the banner to align more with the two reference images provided: NAMELY the character style, contrasting and humurous details, and detailing
